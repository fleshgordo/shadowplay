Shadowplay is a light installation for TIAN's chandelier
(www.tian-vienna.com) 
Concept & Production by design agency STRUKT Vienna 
(www.strukt.com) 
Light Design & Hardware by Gordan Savicic 
(www.yugo.at)

Two pan/tilt robotic units equipped with 10W LEDs were
installed inside the chandelier.  Through algorithmic
controlling of light positioning and brightness (PWM), they
produce different shadows along the ceiling and walls,
inviting the participator to experience various
patterns and reflections which subsequently form
their own spatial narrative.
